# GeoAxis is a Block object, just like Axis or Axis3, with the same semantics.

# You can insert it into a figure in the same way, or specify it when plotting as `plot(...; axis = (; type = GeoAxis, geoaxis_kwargs...))`.
fig = Figure()
ga = GeoAxis(fig[1, 1]; dest = "+proj=ortho +lon_0=19 +lat_0=50")

# This is an orthographic projection, note how it shows the pole as well!
surface!(ga, -180..180, -90..90, rand(100, 100); shading = NoShading)
fig
# You can plot any Makie plot type into the GeoAxis - there is no difference between it and any other axis-like object in Makie.
# Beware that some plot types will create points which cannot support transformations, though!

# If you encounter this kind of issue, please file a GitHub issue at the GeoMakie.jl repo!
