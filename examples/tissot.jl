# # Tissot's indicatrix

#=
Tissot's indicatrix is a way to characterize local distortions in a map projection (see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot%27s_indicatrix)).  

It is traditionally constructed by differentiating the projection.  However, we can implement a similar indicatrix in a more straightforward way, by simply projecting
circles formed on the ellipsoidal Earth onto a map.

Here' we'll show how you can do this for a few projections.

=#

using Proj, GeoMakie, CairoMakie
import GeometryBasics: Point2d
import GeometryOps as GO

# First, we define a function that gets a geodesic circle around some given point:
function geodesic_circle(origin::PointType, radius::Real, npoints = 100; geodesic = Proj.geod_geodesic(6378137, 1/298.257223563)) where PointType <: Point2
    points = [PointType(Proj.geod_direct(geodesic, origin[2], origin[1], θ, radius)[[2, 1]]) for θ in LinRange(0, 360, npoints)]
    if points[end] != points[begin]
        points[end] = points[begin]
    end
    return points
end
poly(geodesic_circle(Point2f(0, 65), 100_000); axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()))
# Note the curvature of the polygon - this is because it's the 
# locus of points which are `radius` away from `origin` on the 
# ellipsoidal Earth, not the flat Earth!

# Now, we can create a proper Tissot map.   Let's examine the Bertin 1953 projection.
f, a, p = lines(GeoMakie.coastlines(); axis = (; type = GeoAxis, dest = "+proj=bertin1953"))
f
# Now, we cn add the Tissot polygons:
lons = LinRange(-180, 180, 13)
lats = LinRange(-90, 90, 7)
circle_polys = [GO.GI.Polygon([geodesic_circle(Point2d(lon, lat), 500_000, 50)]) for lon in lons, lat in lats] |> vec
# circle_polys_cut = GO.cut.(circle_polys, (GO.GI.Line(Point2d[(0, -180), (0, 180)]),)) .|> GO.GI.MultiPolygon # hide
poly!(a, circle_polys; color = Makie.wong_colors(0.7)[2])
f
#
# make cover image #jl
mkpath("covers") #hide
save("covers/$(splitext(basename(@__FILE__))[1]).png", f) #hide
nothing #hide
