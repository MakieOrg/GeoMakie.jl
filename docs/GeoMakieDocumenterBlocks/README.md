# GeoMakieDocumenterBlocks

This package defines Documenter blocks and pipelines that are meant to be used with GeoMakie's example gallery,
but should be universally applicable to similar situations.

The package defines the `@cardmeta` and `@overviewgallery` blocks for GeoMakie, plus a Documenter build step that moves
all `@cardmeta` blocks to the bottom of the page.

For more documentation, see the GeoMakie docs on adding examples.
